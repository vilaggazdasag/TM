Terraforming Mars gamelogs are long, large json files that are hard to analyse in large amounts. 
I wanted to write a script that helps me (and other players) to create a single Excel file from all the gamelogs. 
The main goal of this output file is to extract all production data from all games for all players - so scoring efficiency can be easily determined - and compared to benchmark data

To use the script, you need to replace the folder path the script uses to the location where you store your gamelogs.
I'm sure the code is far from elegant, I created it with ChatGPT with zero Python knowledge and without ever working with json files.
